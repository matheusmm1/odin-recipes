  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These cookies are called World Peace Cookies, they are so good and so addicting that if this recipe was invented prior to 1914 there would have been no world war 1 or any subsequent wars, because all of the world would rather bake and eat these cookies than go to war. If these cookies were around ancient rome times, Alexander the Great would not have conquered all those territories and would instead be known as "Alexander the World Peace Cookies Eater"</p>
    <p>About the actual recipe- World Peace Cookies are easy to make they only take 3 hours and 25 minutes make and about 24 minutes in the oven before they are ready to eat. This recipe will yield about 36 cookies. The cookies are slightly salted, buttery and contain pockets of chocolate; and their texture is crispy on the outside but chewy on the inside</p>
