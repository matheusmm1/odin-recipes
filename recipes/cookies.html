  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These cookies are called World Peace Cookies, they are so good and so addicting that if this recipe was invented prior to 1914 there would have been no world war 1 or any subsequent wars, because all of the world would rather bake and eat these cookies than go to war. If these cookies were around ancient rome times, Alexander the Great would not have conquered all those territories and would instead be known as "Alexander the World Peace Cookies Eater"</p>
    <p>About the actual recipe- World Peace Cookies are easy to make they only take 3 hours and 25 minutes make and about 24 minutes in the oven before they are ready to eat. This recipe will yield about 36 cookies. The cookies are slightly salted, buttery and contain pockets of chocolate; and their texture is crispy on the outside but chewy on the inside</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <uo>
      <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1 stick plus 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
      <li>2/3 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 fine sea salted</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>3/4 cup store-bought mini chocolate chips</li>
    </uo>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
<li>Sift the flour, cocoa and baking soda together</li>
<li>With a hand mixer in a large bowl, beat the butter on medium speed until soft and creamy. Add both sugars, the salt and vanilla extract and beat for 2 minutes more.</li>
<li>Pour in the dry ingredients, drape a kitchen towel over the stand mixer to protect yourself and your kitcen from flying flour and pulse the mixer at low speed about 5 times, a second or two each time. Take a peek - if there is still a lot of flour on the surface of the dough, pulse a couple of times more, if not remove the towel. Continuing at low speed, mix for about 30 seconds more, just until the flour disappears into the dough - for the best texture, work the dough as little as possible once the flour is added, and don't be concerned if the dough looks a little crumbly. Toss in the chocolate pieces and mix only to incorporate.</li>
<li>Turn the dough out onto a work surface, gather it together and divide it in half. Working with one half at a time, shape the dough into logs that are 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap the logs in plastic wrap and refrigerate them for at least 3 hours. (The dough can be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 2 months. If you've frozen the dough, you needn't defrost it before baking — let it warm just enough so that you can slice the log into rounds and bake the cookies 1 minute longer.)</li>
<li>Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 325 °F. Line two baking sheets with parchment or silicone mats.
</li>
<li>Using a sharp thin knife, slice the logs into rounds that are 1/2 inch thick. (The rounds are likely to crack as you're cutting them — don't be concerned, just squeeze the bits back onto each cookie.) Arrange the rounds on the baking sheets, leaving about 1 inch between them.</li>
<li>Bake the cookies one sheet at a time for 12 minutes — they won't look done, nor will they be firm, but that's just the way they should be. Transfer the baking sheet to a cooling rack and let the cookies rest until they are only just warm, at which point you can serve them or let them reach room temperature.</li>
