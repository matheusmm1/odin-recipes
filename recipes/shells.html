  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Stuffed Shells are so good, even though they have spinach in them; this recipe is even easier than the world peace cookie recipe, it takes 20 minutes to make and 30 more minutes to cook.</p>
    <p>These spinach and ricotta stuffed shells are such a comforting, favorful dinner! To get ahead, you can stuff the shells and place them in a baking dish with the marinara up to 4 hours in advance. Cover with foil and store them in the fridge until you're ready to serve!</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>18 to 20 jumbo pasta shells</li>
    <li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
    <li>5 ounces spinach</li>
    <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese, more for sprinkling</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves, grated</li>
    <li>1 teaspoons lemon zest</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon sea salt, more for the pasta water</li>
    <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 cups Marinara Sauce, plus more for serving</li>
    <li>Chopped parsley, for serving</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Before you start mixing up the filling, you will need to steam the spinach. When it is tender and vibrant green, remove it from the heat, place it in a strainer, and squeeze out the excess moisture. Roughly chop it. Then, you can stir it together with the ricotta, pecorino, garlic, lemon zest, oregano, and red pepper flakes to make the filling.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, cook the pasta. It should be just shy of al dente when you drain it. It will finish cooking in the oven.</li>
    <li>Then, stuff the shells. Use a small spoon to fill each shell with the cheese mixture. Divided evenly, the filling should be enough for 18 to 20 shells.</li>
    <li>Next, bake. Spread 2 cups of marinara sauce at the bottom of a 9 by 13 baking dish. Nestle in the shells, cover the dish with foil, and bake for 20 minutes at 425Â°F.Alternatively, if you want to make this recipe ahead of time, you can place the stuffed shells in the baking dish, cover it with foil, and place it in the fridge for up to 4 hours. When you are ready to eat, just bake the shells and serve. For freezing instructions, see the notes in the recipe.</li>
    <li>Before serving, garnish the stuffed shells with more pecorino (or Parmesan) cheese and a sprinkle of fresh parsley. Serve them with extra marinara on the side. I like to spoon it over the shells as I eat so that I can get plenty of sauce in every bite.</li>
